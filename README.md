Javascript Psychic Game

I had originally set out to do the Hangman Style wordguess game, but after restarting it several times, I spent some time with this project and though it isn't as complex.  It was fun to play with.

I had also thought about doing a "Price is Right" themed Guessing game, where you are guessing prices for items all through java script.  I was going to have there is quite a bit of different coding to do, but it seemed interesting.  I would have an if else statement so you automatically lost if you went over the price.  And also give the other players a bit of AI to be able to guess within so many numbers of the price as to keep it competitive.  I would have also been able to possibly trigger music to go with it.  What I wasn't able to find or figure out was how I would put manual delays on peices of script to keep it all from executing immediatly.
